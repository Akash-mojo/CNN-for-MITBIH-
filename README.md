# CNN-for-MITBIH-
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying ECG signals using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset. The project is designed to identify arrhythmia types from pre-processed ECG signals and demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning in cardiovascular signal analysis.
